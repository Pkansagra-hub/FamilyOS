# MemoryOS Security

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

Report security vulnerabilities to **security@memoryos.local**

For detailed security documentation, see:
- `policy/` - Policy framework and enforcement
- `security/` - Cryptographic implementations and key management  
- `docs/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive security design

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

MemoryOS implements a comprehensive security model with:

### Multi-Level Security (MLS)
- **Memory Spaces**: Hierarchical security domains (`personal:*`, `shared:household`, etc.)
- **Security Bands**: GREEN/AMBER/RED/BLACK classification system
- **Cryptographic Isolation**: Per-space encryption with controlled sharing

### Privacy-by-Design
- **On-Device Processing**: All computation happens locally
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Data Minimization**: Automatic PII detection and redaction
- **User Control**: Granular consent and preference management

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**: All requests validated at API edge
- **Continuous Verification**: Authentication and authorization for every operation
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights by default
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Immutable audit trails for all actions

## üîê Key Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **mTLS**: Mutual TLS for device authentication
- **RBAC + ABAC**: Role and attribute-based access control
- **MFA**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Device Attestation**: Hardware-backed device verification

### Data Protection
- **AES-256-GCM**: Authenticated encryption for data at rest
- **Key Ratcheting**: Forward and backward secrecy
- **MLS Groups**: Secure group messaging with perfect forward secrecy
- **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic data erasure

### Privacy Compliance
- **GDPR**: Right to be forgotten, data portability, consent management
- **CCPA**: Consumer privacy rights and transparency
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (where applicable)
- **Data Minimization**: Automated PII detection and redaction

### Network Security
- **TLS 1.3**: Secure peer-to-peer communication
- **Certificate Pinning**: Protection against MITM attacks
- **Peer Verification**: Cryptographic peer identity validation
- **Network Isolation**: Segmented network architecture
