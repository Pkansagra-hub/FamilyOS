## 🧠 **Core Architectural Principles**

### **Memory as Backbone Philosophy**
- **Memory Module = Central Nervous System**: All intelligence, coordination, and family features flow through memory
- **Device-Local First**: Memory resides on user devices with user control, not cloud-dependent
- **E2EE Family Sync**: Encrypted memory sharing creates family intelligence while preserving privacy
- **User-Controlled Permissions**: Simple user commands, not complex ABAC/RBAC on personal devices

### **3 API Planes Serving Memory**
1. **Agent Plane**: LLM agents ↔ Memory operations (recall, formation, intelligence queries)
2. **Tool Plane**: Third-party apps ↔ Memory-enhanced actions (Philips Hue, Bank of America, etc.)
3. **Control Plane**: Family admin ↔ Memory coordination (family management, emergency protocols)
