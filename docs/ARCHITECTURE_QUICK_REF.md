# 🏗️ FamilyOS Architecture Quick Reference

## 📍 **Core Principle**
**Memory Module = Backbone of Family AI**  
Everything flows through memory: intelligence, coordination, family awareness, emotional understanding.

## 🎯 **3 API Planes**
1. **Agent**: LLM ↔ Memory operations
2. **Tool**: Apps ↔ Memory-enhanced actions  
3. **Control**: Family admin ↔ Memory coordination

## 🧠 **Memory Spaces**
```
personal:* → selective:* → shared:household → extended:network → interfamily:*
```

## ⚡ **Key Pipelines**
- **P01-P03**: Memory (Recall, Formation, Consolidation)
- **P04-P06**: Intelligence (Coordination, Care, Learning)  
- **P07-P09**: Sync (E2EE, Access, Devices)
- **P10-P20**: Infrastructure (Privacy, Safety, Features)

## 🏠 **Family-First Design**
- **Device-Local**: Memory on user devices, not cloud
- **E2EE Sync**: Family intelligence through encrypted sharing
- **User Control**: Simple commands, not complex policies
- **Advisory AI**: Users decide, AI suggests
