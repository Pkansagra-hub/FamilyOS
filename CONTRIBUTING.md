## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Async-First**: Use async/await patterns for I/O operations
3. **Type Safety**: Use type hints and maintain mypy compatibility
4. **Event-Driven**: Leverage the event bus for loose coupling
5. **Privacy-Aware**: Consider privacy implications in all designs

### Code Organization

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from I/O and infrastructure
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Use the P01-P20 pipeline architecture
- **Service Layer**: Wrap complex operations in service classes
- **Policy Enforcement**: Apply policies consistently across all operations

### Testing Guidelines

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Pipeline Tests**: Test end-to-end pipeline operations
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure scalability requirements are met

```python
# Example test structure
def test_memory_writer_basic_ingestion():
    """Test basic memory ingestion through writer."""
    # Arrange
    writer = MemoryWriter()
    content = {"text": "test content", "metadata": {}}
    
    # Act
    result = await writer.write(content)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.success
    assert result.memory_id is not None
```

### Documentation Standards

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type Hints**: Provide comprehensive type annotations
- **API Documentation**: Document all public APIs
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document significant design choices

```python
def process_memory_item(
    item: MemoryItem, 
    policy: PolicyConfig
) -> ProcessingResult:
    """Process a memory item through the ingestion pipeline.
    
    Args:
        item: The memory item to process
        policy: Policy configuration for processing
        
    Returns:
        Processing result with success status and metadata
        
    Raises:
        PolicyViolationError: If item violates policy constraints
        ProcessingError: If processing fails unexpectedly
    """
```

## üîç Review Process

### Pull Request Reviews

All contributions go through a review process:

1. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline runs tests and quality checks
2. **Code Review**: Maintainers review code for quality and architecture fit
3. **Testing**: Reviewers may test functionality locally
4. **Documentation**: Ensure adequate documentation is provided

### Review Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Code Quality**: Is it readable, maintainable, and efficient?
- **Tests**: Are there adequate tests with good coverage?
- **Documentation**: Is it properly documented?
- **Architecture**: Does it fit with the overall system design?
- **Security**: Are there any security implications?
- **Privacy**: Does it respect family privacy principles?

## üè∑Ô∏è Issue Labels

We use the following labels to categorize issues:

- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
- `priority-high`: High priority items
- `pipeline-*`: Issues related to specific pipelines (P01-P20)
- `component-*`: Issues related to specific components

## üìû Getting Help

- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and general discussion
- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **Documentation**: Check the docs/ directory for detailed guides
- **Developer Index**: See `develpoer_index.md` for module details

## üéØ Development Priorities

Current focus areas for contributions:

1. **Core Memory Operations** (P01-P02 pipelines)
2. **Security and Privacy** (E2EE, policy enforcement)
3. **Performance Optimization** (embeddings, retrieval)
4. **Testing Coverage** (unit and integration tests)
5. **Documentation** (API docs, tutorials)
