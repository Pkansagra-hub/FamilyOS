**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All epics completed and integrated
- [ ] Full test suite passing (unit + integration + contract)
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed
- [ ] Ready for next milestone dependencies

Please help me plan this milestone with proper epic breakdown and implementation strategy.

## üìã **Epic Planning & Organization**

```
I need to plan an epic within a milestone:

**Epic Context:**
- **Parent Milestone:** [M1-foundation, M2-cognitive-core, etc.]
- **Epic Number:** [1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.]
- **Epic Name:** [event-bus-infrastructure, storage-foundation, etc.]
- **Estimated Duration:** [3-4 weeks typical]

**Epic Objectives:**
- **Primary Goal:** [What this epic achieves]
- **Business Value:** [Why this epic matters]
- **Technical Outcome:** [Specific technical deliverable]
- **Integration Points:** [How it connects to other epics]

**Issue Breakdown:**
Break this epic into 5-8 issues:
- **Issue 1:** [Specific task/feature to implement]
- **Issue 2:** [Next task in logical sequence]
- **Issue 3:** [Subsequent implementation task]
- **Issue 4-8:** [Additional issues as needed]

**Contract Dependencies:**
- **API Contracts:** [OpenAPI specifications needed]
- **Event Contracts:** [Event schemas and envelope changes]
- **Storage Contracts:** [Database schemas and migrations]
- **Integration Contracts:** [Cross-service communication needs]

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Components Affected:** [Which modules/services change]
- **Design Patterns:** [Architectural patterns to apply]
- **Technology Stack:** [Specific tools/libraries needed]
- **Performance Considerations:** [Latency, throughput, resource usage]

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Development Order:** [Logical sequence for issue implementation]
- **Feature Flags:** [How to gate new functionality]
- **Testing Strategy:** [Unit, integration, contract testing approach]
- **Observability Plan:** [Metrics, traces, logs to implement]

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Test Coverage Goals:** [Coverage targets for this epic]
- **Performance Benchmarks:** [Speed and resource targets]
- **Security Requirements:** [Security and privacy needs]
- **Documentation Standards:** [Docs that must be created/updated]

Please help me plan this epic with detailed issue breakdown and implementation approach.

## üìù **Issue Planning & Implementation**

```
I need to plan an individual issue within an epic:

**Issue Context:**
- **Parent Epic:** [M1.1-event-bus, M1.2-storage, etc.]
- **Issue Number:** [1.1.1, 1.1.2, 2.1.3, etc.]
- **Issue Name:** [event-envelope-design, basic-publisher, etc.]
- **Estimated Duration:** [1-5 days typical]

**Issue Objectives:**
- **Specific Goal:** [Exact task to accomplish]
- **Acceptance Criteria:** [Clear success definition]
- **Definition of Done:** [When this issue is complete]
- **Dependencies:** [Other issues that must complete first]

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Files to Modify:** [Specific files that will change]
- **Contract Changes:** [Any contract updates needed]
- **Test Requirements:** [Tests that must be written]
