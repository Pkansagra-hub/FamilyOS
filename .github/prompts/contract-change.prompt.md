**Generation Commands:**
- [ ] `python contracts/automation/interactive_contract_builder.py` (guided creation)
- [ ] `python contracts/automation/contract_suite.py generate --service [service-name] --type [api|events|storage]`
- [ ] Validate with `python contracts/automation/validation_helper.py --service [service-name]`

**Brain Region Mapping:** (for cognitive services)
- [ ] Specify brain region: hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, etc.
