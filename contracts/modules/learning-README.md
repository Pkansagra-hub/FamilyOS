# Learning (P06) Contract (v1.0.0)

**Scope:** P06 Learning/Neuromod pipeline - adaptive learning coordination, neuromodulation, and continuous improvement.

**Purpose:** Orchestrates learning across the cognitive architecture through neuromodulation, pattern analysis, and performance monitoring. Implements adaptive learning loops that adjust system behavior based on outcomes and feedback.
