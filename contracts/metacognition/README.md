# Meta-Cognition Contracts - Phase 4 Complete

## Overview
This directory contains the complete Phase 4 meta-cognition and self-reflection contracts for the brain-inspired cognitive architecture. These contracts establish the highest-order cognitive capabilities including self-awareness, theory of mind, and abstract reasoning.

## Contract Structure

### Event Contracts (`events/schemas/metacognition/`)
- **`metacognitive_monitoring.json`** - Events for cognitive process monitoring, strategy assessment, and self-regulation
- **`self_reflection.json`** - Events for introspective awareness, self-analysis, and personal insight generation
- **`theory_of_mind.json`** - Events for mental state attribution, perspective taking, and social cognition
- **`higher_order_thinking.json`** - Events for abstract reasoning, meta-learning, and cognitive architecture awareness

### Storage Contracts (`storage/schemas/metacognition/`)
- **`metacognitive_state.json`** - Comprehensive meta-cognitive state storage including self-model, monitoring state, and theory of mind models
- **`self_model.json`** - Detailed self-model storage including cognitive, behavioral, social, and temporal self-representations

### API Contracts (`api/schemas/metacognition/`)
- **`metacognitive_monitoring.json`** - API endpoints for cognitive monitoring, strategy assessment, and regulation
- **`self_reflection.json`** - API endpoints for self-reflection initiation, analysis, and insight generation
- **`theory_of_mind.json`** - API endpoints for mental state attribution, perspective taking, and social prediction
- **`higher_order_thinking.json`** - API endpoints for abstract reasoning, meta-learning, and system optimization

## Neural Substrate Modeling

All contracts include brain-inspired neural circuit modeling based on:

### Key Brain Regions
- **Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC)** - Self-referential processing and introspection
- **Frontopolar Cortex** - Cognitive branching and higher-order planning
- **Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)** - Self-awareness and autobiographical memory
- **Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ)** - Theory of mind and perspective taking
- **Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS)** - Social cognition and agency detection

### Neural Networks
- **Default Mode Network (DMN)** - Self-referential thought and introspection
- **Central Executive Network (CEN)** - Metacognitive control and monitoring
- **Salience Network** - Attention switching and relevance detection

## Capabilities Implemented

### 2. Self-Reflection
- Structured introspective analysis
- Personal insight generation
- Identity integration and coherence
- Autobiographical reflection

### 3. Theory of Mind
- Mental state attribution to others
- Perspective taking and empathy
- Recursive theory of mind reasoning
- False belief understanding
- Social behavior prediction

### 4. Higher-Order Thinking
- Abstract reasoning and analogical thinking
- Meta-learning optimization
- Cognitive architecture awareness
- Paradigm-level thinking
- Conceptual breakthroughs
- Transfer learning capabilities

## Integration Points

These meta-cognition contracts integrate with:
- **Phase 1**: Foundational attention and consciousness systems
- **Phase 2**: Memory consolidation and retrieval systems
- **Phase 3**: Executive control and planning systems
- **Social Cognition**: Interpersonal understanding and collaboration
- **Affect**: Emotional regulation and affective processing

## Validation Status
✅ All contracts validated for JSON Schema syntax
✅ Neuroanatomical accuracy verified
✅ System integration specified
✅ Brain-inspired design principles followed

## Next Steps
With Phase 4 complete, the brain-inspired cognitive architecture contracts are now comprehensive and ready for implementation. The contracts provide:
- Complete neural substrate modeling
- Comprehensive capability definitions
- Robust integration specifications
- Validation-ready schemas

This concludes the contract development phase and establishes the foundation for implementing a neuroanatomically-accurate, brain-inspired cognitive architecture system.
