title: "Action Arbitration & Decision Contract"
description: |
  Implements intelligent family action arbitration and decision-making for Memory-Centric Family AI.
  Provides conflict resolution, priority ranking, family consensus mechanisms, and intelligent
  action scheduling to manage competing family action requests harmoniously.

  **Arbitration Architecture:**
  - Family Decision Engine: Family-aware conflict resolution and priority ranking
  - Consensus Builder: Family agreement facilitation and compromise generation
  - Resource Coordinator: Family resource allocation and scheduling optimization
  - Priority Arbitrator: Multi-dimensional family priority assessment and ranking

  **Family Decision Features:**
  - Family hierarchy-aware decision making
  - Age-appropriate family member participation
  - Family value-aligned priority assessment
  - Compromise generation for family harmony
