    Memory-Centric Family AI Cognitive Event Architecture

    This AsyncAPI specification defines cognitive events for the brain-inspired architecture
    that powers Family AI's memory backbone. Events support sophisticated cognitive processing
    including attention gating, working memory management, hippocampal encoding, global
    workspace broadcasting, and family-aware intelligence operations.

    ## Memory-Centric Cognitive Architecture

    ### Brain-Inspired Pipelines (P01-P20)
    - **P01-P02**: Context retrieval and memory formation with family context
    - **P03**: Memory consolidation with family relationship strengthening
    - **P04**: Action arbitration with family coordination intelligence
    - **P05**: Prospective memory with family scheduling awareness
    - **P06-P08**: Learning modulation and embedding lifecycle for family patterns
    - **P09-P12**: Integration, privacy, and E2EE for family security
    - **P13-P15**: Index optimization and duplicate detection across family memory
    - **P16-P20**: Feature flags, governance, safety, personalization, and habits

    ### Cognitive Components
    - **Attention Gate/Thalamus**: Salience evaluation and cognitive admission control
    - **Working Memory**: Capacity management and executive coordination
    - **Hippocampus**: Episodic encoding, memory formation, and consolidation
    - **Global Workspace**: Conscious access and cross-module broadcasting
    - **Affect System**: Emotional processing and regulation
    - **Social Cognition**: Theory of mind and family relationship processing

    ## Event Flow Architecture

    All cognitive events use the Memory-Centric Family AI envelope with:
    - `family_memory_id`: Links events to family memory patterns
    - `relationship_context`: Active family relationships affecting processing
    - `emotional_context`: Emotional state influencing cognitive operations
    - `memory_space`: Memory space classification (personal/selective/shared/extended/interfamily)
    - `cognitive_trace_id`: End-to-end cognitive processing correlation
