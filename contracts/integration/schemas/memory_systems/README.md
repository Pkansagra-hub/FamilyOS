# Memory System Integration Contracts

This directory contains comprehensive contracts defining the integration and coordination between different memory systems in the brain-inspired FamilyOS architecture. These contracts specify how the hippocampal memory system coordinates with other cognitive systems to create a unified memory architecture.

## Overview

The memory system integration contracts define sophisticated coordination mechanisms that mirror the neuroscientific understanding of how different memory systems interact in the human brain. These contracts enable seamless information flow, resource coordination, and functional specialization across multiple memory systems.
