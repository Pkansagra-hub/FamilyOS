    **Memory-Centric Family AI - Global Workspace Theory Implementation**

    Implements Global Workspace Theory for Memory-Centric Family AI consciousness with family-aware broadcasting, cognitive system integration, and family consciousness coordination.

    **Global Workspace Theory Features:**
    - Consciousness Theater: Family-wide information broadcasting stage with memory enhancement
    - Audience Systems: Family cognitive systems receiving broadcasts with memory coordination
    - Competition Process: Memory-driven family information priority competition
    - Integration Process: Family consciousness synthesis with memory backbone coordination

    **Family Broadcasting Capabilities:**
    - Family-wide consciousness content distribution with memory patterns
    - Family member selective consciousness access with relationship awareness
    - Family priority-based consciousness broadcasting with memory enhancement
    - Family emergency consciousness override with memory-driven escalation

    **Memory Integration Features:**
    - Memory-enhanced consciousness content relevance scoring
    - Family memory pattern recognition for broadcasting optimization
    - Cross-device consciousness synchronization via memory backbone
    - Memory-driven family awareness distribution and coordination
