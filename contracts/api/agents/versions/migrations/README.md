# Agent Plane API Migration Framework

## Overview

This migration framework provides comprehensive support for evolving Agent Plane APIs while maintaining family safety, data integrity, and backward compatibility. All migrations prioritize family continuity and preserve family memory and coordination capabilities.

## Migration Philosophy

### Family-First Migration Principles

1. **Family Continuity Priority** - Never disrupt family coordination or break family workflows during migrations
2. **Memory Preservation** - All family memories must be preserved and accessible throughout migration process
3. **Child Safety Maintenance** - Child protection features must remain active and enhanced during migrations
4. **Transparent Family Communication** - Families receive clear communication about changes and benefits
5. **Gradual Rollout** - New features roll out gradually with family approval and feedback integration

## Migration Types

### 1. **Compatible Feature Additions** (MINOR version)

New capabilities that enhance family experience without breaking existing functionality:

```yaml
Migration Type: Compatible Feature Addition
Version Change: v1.2.0 → v1.3.0
Family Impact: Enhanced capabilities, no disruption
Approval Required: Family notification, opt-in for new features
Rollback: Automatic if family satisfaction drops

Example Migration:
- Add new emotional intelligence capabilities
- Enhance family coordination features
- Improve memory recall accuracy
- Add new child safety protections
```

### 2. **Behavioral Improvements** (PATCH version)

Bug fixes and performance improvements that benefit families:

```yaml
Migration Type: Behavioral Improvement
Version Change: v1.2.3 → v1.2.4
Family Impact: Better performance, bug fixes
Approval Required: Family notification only
Rollback: Automatic if issues detected

Example Migration:
- Fix memory sync timing issues
- Improve conversation response accuracy
- Enhance emotional context detection
- Optimize family device coordination
```

### 3. **Breaking Changes** (MAJOR version)

Significant changes that require family participation and migration planning:

```yaml
Migration Type: Breaking Change
Version Change: v1.x.x → v2.0.0
Family Impact: New capabilities, migration required
Approval Required: Explicit family consent with migration plan
Rollback: Manual with family support assistance

Example Migration:
- New memory architecture with enhanced privacy
- Updated family relationship model
- Redesigned conversation interface
- Enhanced multi-generational support
```

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Family Impact Assessment

```python
# family_migration_assessment.py
class FamilyMigrationAssessment:
    """Assess migration impact on family before execution"""

    def assess_family_impact(self, migration_spec, family_profile):
