# Control Plane Integration Tests

## Overview

This module provides comprehensive integration testing for the Control Plane APIs within the Memory-Centric Family AI ecosystem. Integration tests validate family governance workflows, subscription lifecycle management, system oversight coordination, and cross-plane integration with Agent and App planes.

## Integration Test Execution

### Running Control Plane Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all Control Plane integration tests
python -m ward test --path contracts/api/control/tests/integration/

# Run specific integration test suites
python -m ward test --path contracts/api/control/tests/integration/test_family_governance_workflows.py
python -m ward test --path contracts/api/control/tests/integration/test_emergency_response_integration.py
python -m ward test --path contracts/api/control/tests/integration/test_subscription_lifecycle.py

# Run cross-plane integration tests
python -m ward test --path contracts/api/control/tests/integration/test_cross_plane_coordination.py

# Run family workflow integration tests
python -m ward test --path contracts/api/control/tests/integration/ --tags family_workflows

# Run system oversight integration tests
python -m ward test --path contracts/api/control/tests/integration/ --tags system_oversight
```

### Integration Test Environment

Integration tests require:

- **Family governance test harness** with democratic decision-making simulation
- **Emergency response simulator** with family coordination protocols
- **Subscription management test environment** with billing and plan management
- **System monitoring test infrastructure** with health and performance simulation
- **Cross-plane coordination simulator** for Agent/App/Control integration
- **Family satisfaction measurement** integrated into all test scenarios

### Integration Test Reporting

Integration test results include:

- **Family governance workflow success** with democratic participation validation
- **Emergency response effectiveness** with family coordination and safety validation
- **Subscription lifecycle management** with family billing and optimization validation
- **System oversight coordination** with health monitoring and maintenance validation
- **Cross-plane integration effectiveness** with memory-driven optimization validation
- **Family satisfaction correlation** with workflow improvements and system enhancements
