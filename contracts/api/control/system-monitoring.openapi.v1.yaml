  description: |
    **Memory-Centric Family AI System Monitoring Operations**

    This API provides family administrators with comprehensive system monitoring capabilities:
    - **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor Memory Backbone performance, Family Intelligence operations, and system resource utilization
    - **Health Management**: Monitor system health, component status, and operational readiness across family devices
    - **Diagnostics & Troubleshooting**: Advanced diagnostics, error analysis, and system troubleshooting capabilities
    - **Capacity Planning**: Monitor system capacity, resource usage patterns, and scaling requirements
    - **Operational Intelligence**: System analytics, performance insights, and operational optimization recommendations

    **Memory-Centric Design**: System monitoring leverages Memory Backbone for:
    - Memory-driven system intelligence through memory-based performance pattern recognition and system optimization
    - Memory-informed health monitoring with historical system performance analysis and predictive health insights
    - Cross-family system intelligence with system memory synthesis and performance optimization across family devices
    - System evolution tracking through memory-aware system development and performance adaptation

    **Architecture Integration**:
    - Integrates with Memory Backbone for memory-informed system monitoring and performance intelligence
    - Leverages Family Intelligence for relationship-aware system monitoring and family device coordination
    - Coordinates with Intelligence Layer for advanced system analytics and monitoring optimization
    - Monitors family system health through comprehensive monitoring engine and real-time health tracking
