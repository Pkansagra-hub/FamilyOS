# Memory-Centric Family AI - API Versioning Framework

## Overview

This comprehensive versioning framework governs API evolution across all three planes of Memory-Centric Family AI: Agent Plane, App Plane, and Control Plane. The framework prioritizes family continuity, child safety, privacy protection, and transparent family communication throughout API evolution.

## Family-First Versioning Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Family Continuity Above All** - API changes must never disrupt family coordination, memory access, or essential family workflows
2. **Child Safety Enhancement** - Every API version must maintain or improve child protection and safety measures
3. **Privacy Strengthening** - Privacy protections must be enhanced with each version, never weakened
4. **Democratic Family Approval** - Breaking changes require explicit family approval through democratic family decision-making
5. **Transparent Evolution** - Families understand what changes, why changes benefit them, and how to control changes

## Semantic Versioning for Family AI

### Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

#### **PATCH Versions** (Family Benefits Only)
- **Family Impact**: Improved performance, bug fixes, enhanced reliability
- **Family Approval**: Notification only, automatic application
- **Examples**:
  - `1.2.3 → 1.2.4`: Fixed memory sync timing for better family coordination
  - `2.1.5 → 2.1.6`: Improved emotional intelligence accuracy for family conversations
  - `1.4.8 → 1.4.9`: Enhanced child safety content filtering

```yaml
Patch Version Criteria:
  - Performance improvements that benefit families
  - Bug fixes that improve family experience
  - Security enhancements that protect families
  - Reliability improvements for family workflows
  - No changes to API contracts or family behavior
```

#### **MINOR Versions** (New Family Capabilities)
- **Family Impact**: New features that enhance family experience
- **Family Approval**: Demonstration and opt-in approval required
- **Examples**:
  - `1.2.0 → 1.3.0`: Added advanced family emotion detection and response
  - `2.1.0 → 2.2.0`: New family financial coordination features
  - `1.4.0 → 1.5.0`: Enhanced multi-generational family support

```yaml
Minor Version Criteria:
  - New API endpoints that add family capabilities
  - Enhanced family coordination features
  - Additional child safety protections
  - Improved family privacy controls
  - Extended family memory capabilities
  - Backward compatible changes only
```

#### **MAJOR Versions** (Family System Evolution)
- **Family Impact**: Fundamental improvements requiring family participation
- **Family Approval**: Explicit family consent with comprehensive migration plan
- **Examples**:
  - `1.x.x → 2.0.0`: New memory architecture with enhanced family privacy
  - `2.x.x → 3.0.0`: Advanced family governance models with expanded democracy
  - `1.x.x → 2.0.0`: Next-generation family device coordination

```yaml
Major Version Criteria:
  - Breaking changes to API contracts
  - New family architecture with significant benefits
  - Enhanced family governance models
  - Advanced family privacy protection systems
  - Revolutionary family coordination capabilities
  - Requires explicit family approval and migration
```

## Cross-Plane Version Coordination

### Synchronized Release Strategy

All three API planes coordinate releases to ensure seamless family experience:

```yaml
Release Coordination Matrix:
  Agent Plane v2.1.0:
    - Enhanced family memory capabilities
    - Improved emotional intelligence
    - Advanced child interaction safety

  App Plane v2.1.0:
    - App integrations leveraging new memory features
    - Enhanced family coordination through apps
    - Improved child-safe app connectivity

  Control Plane v2.1.0:
    - Governance for new memory capabilities
    - Subscription management for enhanced features
    - System monitoring for new coordination patterns

Family Experience: Seamless enhancement across all planes
```

### Version Compatibility Matrix

```yaml
Cross-Plane Compatibility Requirements:
  Agent Plane v2.x.x:
    Compatible With:
      - App Plane v2.x.x (full family coordination)
      - Control Plane v2.x.x (complete governance integration)
    Limited Compatibility:
      - App Plane v1.8+ (basic coordination only)
      - Control Plane v1.9+ (essential governance only)

  Breaking Compatibility:
    - Family AI never allows incompatible versions to operate together
    - Automatic coordination ensures family experience integrity
    - Family migration support bridges version differences
```

## Family-Centric Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Family Impact Assessment

```python
# family_impact_assessment.py

## API Evolution Best Practices

### Family-First Evolution Guidelines

1. **Always Enhance, Never Degrade**
   - Every version must improve family experience
   - Child safety must be enhanced, never reduced
   - Privacy protection must be strengthened, never weakened
   - Family coordination must be improved, never disrupted

2. **Democratic Family Participation**
   - Breaking changes require explicit family approval
   - Families participate in version planning and feedback
   - Children have age-appropriate voice in API evolution
   - Family autonomy is preserved and enhanced

3. **Transparent Communication**
   - Families understand what changes and why
   - Benefits are clearly demonstrated before implementation
   - Risks are honestly communicated and mitigated
   - Rollback procedures are always available and explained

4. **Continuous Family Satisfaction**
   - Family satisfaction is monitored throughout version lifecycle
   - Automatic rollback triggers protect family experience
   - Family feedback drives future version planning
   - Version success is measured by family benefit, not technical metrics
