Sub-issue #8.1 Implementation Summary: Connect RBAC roles to SecurityContext ✅ COMPLETE

Implementation Overview:
=======================

This sub-issue successfully implemented the bridge between API SecurityContext and
Policy engine RBAC/ABAC systems, enabling seamless integration of role-based and
attribute-based access control for all MemoryOS API requests.

Key Components Implemented:
========================

1. SecurityContextBridge (policy/security_bridge.py)
   - 372 lines of comprehensive integration logic
   - Converts API SecurityContext to ABAC ActorAttrs/DeviceAttrs/EnvAttrs
   - Maps API capabilities to policy permissions
   - Resolves user roles from RBAC engine
   - Implements performance caching for role lookups
   - Supports all three API planes (Agents, App, Control)

2. PolicyService Integration (policy/service.py)
   - Updated to use SecurityContextBridge for context conversion
   - Fixed field access to use proper SecurityContext schema (user_id, device_id)
   - Handles Actor type conversion for event processing
   - Maintains proper type safety and error handling

3. Package Exports (policy/__init__.py)
   - Added SecurityContextBridge to __all__ exports
   - Enables clean imports for API middleware integration

Core Features:
=============

✅ Context Conversion: API SecurityContext → Policy ABAC Context
   - Actor attributes (user_id, roles, permissions)
   - Device attributes (device_id, trust_level)
   - Environment attributes (curfew hours, time context)

✅ Capability Mapping: API → Policy Permissions
   - WRITE → ["memory.write", "memory.submit", "memory.ingest"]
   - RECALL → ["memory.read", "memory.query", "memory.search"]
   - PROJECT → ["memory.project", "memory.share", "memory.reference"]
   - SCHEDULE → ["prospective.manage", "prospective.schedule"]

✅ Role Resolution: User ID → RBAC Roles
   - Queries RBAC engine for user role bindings
   - Handles multiple role inheritance
   - Supports space-scoped role assignments
   - Defaults to "guest" role for security

✅ Performance Optimization:
   - LRU cache for role lookups (60s TTL)
   - Deduplication of role and permission lists
   - Efficient space pattern matching

Integration Points:
==================

The SecurityContextBridge integrates with:
- FastAPI middleware (api/middleware/)
- Policy decision engine (policy/decision_engine.py)
- RBAC engine (policy/rbac.py)
- ABAC context system (policy/abac.py)

Usage Example:
=============

```python
# In API middleware
security_ctx = SecurityContext(
    user_id="user_123",
    device_id="device_456",
    authenticated=True,
    capabilities=[Capability.WRITE, Capability.RECALL],
    trust_level=TrustLevel.GREEN
)

# Convert for policy evaluation
abac_ctx = policy_service.security_bridge.to_abac_context(security_ctx)

# Now can evaluate policies with full context
decision = policy_service.check_api_operation(
    security_ctx, "memory.write", "shared:family"
)
```

Testing and Validation:
=======================

✅ All type errors resolved
✅ SecurityContextBridge imports successfully
✅ Capability mappings working correctly (4 mappings configured)
✅ RBAC integration functional
✅ Ready for Sub-issue #8.2 (capability-based authorization)

Next Steps:
==========

Sub-issue #8.1 is COMPLETE. Ready to proceed with:
- Sub-issue #8.2: Implement capability-based authorization (1 day)
- Sub-issue #8.3: Create policy testing framework (1 day)

The foundation for policy-SecurityContext integration is now solid and ready
for the next phase of implementation.
